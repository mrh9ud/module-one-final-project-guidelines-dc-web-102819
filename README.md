<!-- Ruby Overflow: -->

We created Ruby Overflow as a narrower rendition of the well-known Stack Overflow application. Ruby Overflow functions as a subset of its parent that focuses on topics related to the Ruby programming lanuage and its related software. We hope that you may find it useful, and please call Jose Romero at 443-848-0869 or Matthew Heavner at 540-271-0906 with any suggestions or concerns. You're currently viewing version 1.0. Our hope is to soon integrate relevant sections of the Stack Overflow API.

<!-- Install: -->

Open the main directory for the program through your console. Perform a bundle install to retrieve the gems from the program's gem file that are relevant for its proper functionality. If you encounter any issues with your bundle install, please reference materials on http://rubygems.org. 

After a successful bundle install, launch the program while inside the main directory by inputting "ruby bin/run.rb" into your console. We hope you enjoy our product.
